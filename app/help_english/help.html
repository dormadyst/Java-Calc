        <h2>Entering Values</h2>
        <img src="values.png" style="width:225px;height:350px;">
        <p>
            Much like any other calculator values must be entered before any operation can be performed.
            On this product values can be entered using the standard numeric keypad as highlighted in the image above.
            The numeric keypad works much like it does on any other calculator.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The decimal button, denoted by a '.' is used to enter decimal numbers. Pressing the decimal button places a decimal point in the number currently displayed on the calculator. If there is no number displayed, pressing the decimal button will automatically prefix the decimal point with a zero, forming '0.' This allows you to enter fractional numbers less than one.

        <h2>Entering Units</h2>

        <p>
            Unlike other calculators, this one allows for more flexibility with units. Expressions can be calculated with or without units. Units, if required, can be selected from a dropdown menu, which includes a 'unitless' option for calculations that do not require specific units. Additionally, the dropdown menu provides a blank option where custom units can be input. This functionality is accessible by clicking on the dropdown highlighted in the left image; once clicked, it expands as shown in the right image, allowing a unit or custom input to be selected by clicking. If a custom unit is input from the unit dropdown initially, there are no conversions.

        <h2>Custom Like Units (With Conversions)</h2>
        <img src="unitsMenu1.png" style="width:225px;height:350px;">
        <img src="unitsMenu2.png" style="width:225px;height:350px;"><br>

        <p>
             Custom units can also be loaded so that new like units are defined with conversion factors. This is achieved by using the "Add" button underneath the "Units" menu as seen in the left picture above. Then, as seen in the left picture above, the new like unit name is entered, then the type/unit it is to be converted with, and then the conversion factor. For example, to enter the custom unit "furlong" in relation to meters, you would enter "Furlong" as the name, "m" as the type, and 201.168 as the conversion factor because 1 furlong is equal to 201.168 meters.

        <h2>Selecting Operations</h2>
        <img src="operation.png" style="width:225px;height:350px;"><br>
        <p>
            The process of selecting operations functions as would be expected of a traditional calculator. Operations must be selected between the entering of each operand. They can be selected using the buttons in the rightmost column as shown in the image. Each button corresponds to one of the basic operations, represented by the symbol on its face. Additionally, there is now an exponent button which, when pressed, brings up a window allowing users to input both the number and its exponent. This feature enhances the calculator's functionality, making it more versatile for complex calculations.

        <h2>Evaluating</h2>
        <img src="eval.png" style="width:225px;height:350px;"><br>
        <p>
            Now to put it all together. First a left operand with a value and a selected unit must be
            entered on the lower display. Then an operation must be selected this will send both up to 
            the upper display. Then a second operand with a value and a unit must be entered on the
            lower display. The to evaluate the expression the "=" button as shown in the image must be 
            selected. After its selection the expression with be evaluated and the expression and the result
            will be shown in the upper display.
